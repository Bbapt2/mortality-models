# Mortality models

This repository contains material about some well-known mortality models.
The aim was to code from scratch **Lee-Carter**, **Cairns-Blake-Dowd**, **Age-Period-Cohort**, **M6**, **M7** and **M8** models.

This work was inspired by the [StMoMo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/StMoMo/versions/0.4.1) package in R.

It will be completed with other models and functionalities.
